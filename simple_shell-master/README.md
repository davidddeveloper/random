# Project Title

 Simple shell(Creating a simple Unix command line interpreter) is an Alx project created by David conteh and Gbenmo Ese started on 29th November, 2023.

## Description

A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.
Generally, a shell is a program that executes other programs in response to text commands. A sophisticated shell can also change the environment in which other programs execute by passing named variables, a parameter list, or an input source.


## Installation

1. Compile the C Source Code: You need to compile your C source code into an executable file. You can use the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for this purpose. The GCC is a compiler system produced by the GNU Project supporting various programming languages. It is a key component of the GNU toolchain. Here's how you can do it:
	   gcc shell.c -o shell
This command compiles the shell.c file and outputs an executable file named shell. Replace shell.c with the name of the C source file.

2. Run the Shell: After successfully compiling the C source code, you can run the shell by executing the following command:
	   ./shell
This command runs the shell executable file.

## Usage

Running the shell executable and interacting with it through the command line. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use it:

1. Run the Shell: After you've compiled your shell program, you can run it by executing the following command in your terminal:
	  ./shell
This command runs the shell executable file.

2. Interact with the Shell: Once the shell is running, you can start interacting with it. You'll see a prompt that indicates the shell is ready to accept commands. Typically, this prompt might look something like $ or (Eshell) $ .
Here's how you can use the shell:

3. Execute Commands: You can execute any command that you would normally run in a terminal. For example, you can list the files in the current directory by typing ls and pressing Enter.

4. Use Built-in Commands: If your shell has built-in commands (like cd, exit, etc.), you can use them directly in the shell. For example, you can change the current directory by typing cd /path/to/directory and pressing Enter.

5. Handle Errors: If you try to execute a command that doesn't exist or if there's a problem with the command, the shell should print an error message.
Exit the Shell: You can exit the shell by typing exit or .exit (or whatever exit command your shell supports) and pressing Enter
